Title: AI Engineer (LLM Applications)

About the role
You will build LLM-powered features that are reliable, testable, and safe to operate in production. You’ll collaborate with product, engineering, and security to ship AI capabilities that deliver measurable user value.

Key responsibilities
- Design and implement LLM application patterns (tools/functions, RAG, structured outputs).
- Build evaluation harnesses for quality, latency, and cost; define acceptance thresholds.
- Implement prompt/version management and rollout strategies (A/B, canary).
- Improve retrieval quality: chunking, embeddings, filters, ranking, and citations.
- Partner with platform teams on observability, tracing, and incident response.

Required skills
- Strong Python or TypeScript; experience shipping backend services.
- Hands-on experience with at least one LLM framework (LangChain/LlamaIndex or equivalent).
- Practical understanding of data privacy, prompt injection risks, and safe-guards.

Nice to have
- Experience running models locally and in containers; GPU basics.
- Familiarity with vector stores and search (FAISS, pgvector, Elasticsearch).
- Experience with regulated environments (SOC2, ISO27001).

Tech stack (example)
Python, FastAPI, Postgres, Redis, Docker, OpenTelemetry.
