Title: Senior Backend Engineer

About the role
You will design and build backend services that are secure, observable, and maintainable. You’ll lead technical decisions, improve system reliability, and support cross-team delivery.

Key responsibilities
- Design APIs and data models; drive reviews and align stakeholders.
- Build scalable services with strong testing and performance practices.
- Implement observability: logs, metrics, traces, and meaningful alerts.
- Improve reliability: rate limiting, retries, circuit breakers, and runbooks.
- Mentor engineers and raise overall engineering standards.

Required skills
- Strong experience in one backend language (Python/Java/Go/Node).
- Knowledge of relational databases and operational concerns (migrations, indexing).
- Familiarity with security basics (authn/authz, secrets, OWASP).

Nice to have
- Event-driven architecture and messaging experience.
- Experience building AI-adjacent services (retrieval, search, inference gateways).

Tech stack (example)
TypeScript/Node or Python, Postgres, Redis, REST/GraphQL, Docker.
