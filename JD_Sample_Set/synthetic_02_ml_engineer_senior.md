Title: Senior Machine Learning Engineer

About the role
You will lead the delivery of ML models from problem framing through deployment and monitoring. You’ll own model performance in production and mentor engineers on robust ML engineering practices.

Key responsibilities
- Translate business goals into ML problem statements, metrics, and baselines.
- Build training pipelines and production inference services.
- Define model monitoring: drift, bias checks, data quality, and alerting.
- Run experiments and communicate results to technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Review designs, improve standards, and coach teammates.

Required skills
- Strong Python and experience with PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- Experience with feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
- Production experience: APIs, CI/CD, testing, and observability.

Nice to have
- Knowledge of ranking/recommender systems or time-series forecasting.
- Experience with model governance and documentation.
- Familiarity with cloud ML services (SageMaker/Azure ML/Vertex AI).

Tech stack (example)
Python, PyTorch, MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes, Postgres.
